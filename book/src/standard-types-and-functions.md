### Prelude

When compiling an expression, the compiler automatically inserts a small prelude before the expression itself, which gives automatic access to basic operators such as `+`, `-`, etc as well as types such as `Option` and `Result`.

### Threads and channels

Gluon has support for cooperative threading and communication between them through the `Thread` and `Sender`/`Receiver` types.
